# EscapeEvil5
This is a game I made in 2019. It was fun, had a few bosses. But in all honestly it was pathetic. One of the first games I actually finished and was able to genuinly publish. Im archiving it because I dont need it to be active, I havent worked on it for 2 years but dont want to delete it.
